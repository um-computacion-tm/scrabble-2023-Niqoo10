<h1 align="center"> SCRABBLE GAME </h1>

<em> INTRODUCTION </em>

Scrabble is a board game in which each player tries to earn more points by building words on a board of 15x15 square cells. Words can be formed, as long as they appear in the standard dictionary, horizontally or vertically and can be crossed.

<em> CHARACTERISTICS </em>

The game is played between 2, 3 or 4 players (generally it is played in pairs), on a board of 15x15 square spaces, on which each player places their pieces. Each player receives a specific number of randomly drawn tiles (or letters). The letters are numbered with their respective value, obtaining a score for each word formed that depends on both the value of the letters used and the position of said letters within the board.

In total there are 100 tiles, 98 marked with letters and two blank (without dots, they act as wildcards and are used to replace letters). Depending on their frequency of appearance, letters have more or fewer points, those with a higher frequency are always worth less. The board also has award boxes, which multiply the number of points awarded: the dark red boxes are "triple word", the pink ones "double word", dark blue "triple letter" and light blue "double letter". The center box is marked with a star and counts as a double word box; It is mandatory that the game starts using this space.
