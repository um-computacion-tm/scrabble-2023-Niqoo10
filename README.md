<h1 align="center"> SCRABBLE GAME </h1>

The game of Scrabble is a word game in which players form words on a board using letter tiles and score points based on the value of each letter. Here's an overview of how Scrabble is played:

Objective: The objective of the Scrabble game is to earn more points than the other players by forming words on the board.

<em> MATERIALS </em>

    Game board with special squares.
    100 tokens with letters and their point values.
    Supports for the tokens.
    Bag to steal chips.
    Dictionary (optional to resolve disputes over valid words).

<em> PREPARATION </em>

    Each player chooses a tile at random to determine the initial turn.
    Players choose 7 tiles at random and place them in their holders.
    The rest of the chips are placed in the bag.

<em> GAME DEVELOPMENT </em>

    Players take turns clockwise.
    On your turn, you can form words on the board using the tiles in your holder.
    The words must connect with the words already existing on the board.
    The letters you use on your turn must touch at least one tile on the board.
    The pieces can be placed horizontally or vertically on the board.
    You earn points based on the value of the letters on the tiles you placed. Some spaces on the board multiply the value of the pieces or the entire word.
    You draw tokens from the bag at the end of your turn to keep 7 tokens in your holder.
    Play continues until tokens are exhausted and one player uses all of his tokens, or if all players pass two consecutive turns.
    The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.
